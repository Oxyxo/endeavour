## Additional information
This is my first front-end project in Angular and with TypeScript. I originally have worked with Python + SQL and data analysis. 

I built this project using Angular and TypeScript as requested. I am using RxJS to make use of the Observables in Angular.
I display art objects only if they have an attached image in Rijksmuseum. You can search for art objects in the search field. The search result displays 10 objects per page.
If you click on one of the objects, a new page will display a full sized image of the object as well as more information.
I have added links to Rijksmuseum and Rijks Studio.
